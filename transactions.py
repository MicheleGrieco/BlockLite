    Creates a random transaction between Alice and Bob, where the amount is between -maxValue and maxValue.
    The sum of deposits and withdrawals must be 0 (tokens are neither created nor destroyed).

    The transaction is represented as a dictionary with account names as keys and amounts as values.
