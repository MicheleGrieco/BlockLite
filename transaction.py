    makeTransaction(maxValue=3) -> dict
    Creates a random transaction between Alice and Bob, where the amount is between -maxValue and maxValue.
    The sum of deposits and withdrawals must be 0 (tokens are neither created nor destroyed)
    A userâ€™s account must have sufficient funds to cover any withdrawals.
    The transaction is represented as a dictionary with account names as keys and amounts as values.
    The function returns a dictionary with the transaction details.
    The transaction is guaranteed to be valid according to the rules defined in the isValidTxn function.
